The Nottingham Trent University's (NTU) Developers Society is a student run society that is open to tech enthusiasts and developers from all courses and backgrounds. We primarily host workshops and events to help our members further hone their skillsets as future developers. 
In addition to this we also host a few different open-source projects that our members are encouraged to contribute to.
